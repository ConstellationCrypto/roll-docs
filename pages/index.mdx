# Introducing Form

Form is an Ethereum L2 built to advance the SocialFi ecosystem, giving each user the freedom to transact in and across all platforms. The network plans to progressively decentralize itself after its mainnet launch.

Form is a simple way to decentralize and power SocialFi apps with interoperability. We envision SocialFi as a composable ecosystem where online communities can aggregate value and utility across all DeFi, SocialFi and decentralized applications.

Form is a permissionless Layer 2 blockchain powered by the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) and secured by Ethereum. The network is incubated by Roll Labs who contribute to Form but do not operate the Form network itself.

The Form network will continue to advance Ethereum through high-speed block times, significantly lower gas fees, native account abstraction and expanding the possibilities of an on-chain world.

Form is building decentralized, composable and censorship-resistant SocialFi. Come build with us. Get in touch with Form [here](https://roll010551.typeform.com/to/WnHWqjAA) to get started.

 
{/* Form is a platform that uses blockchain technology to bring social tokens to life.
Form mints social tokens for creators on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC20 tokens. These are fungible tokens that can be easily traded on exchanges and used in applications across the web.

Form provides creators with an interface to distribute and share social tokens with their followers on other platforms and set up rewards for their followers to redeem social tokens for unique experiences across the web. 

Earn, redeem, send and trade social tokens across the internet. Web 2.0 or Web 3.0, itâ€™s easy with Form. */}
