# What is Form Testnet?
 
Form is a platform that uses blockchain technology to bring social tokens to life.
Form mints social tokens for creators on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC20 tokens. These are fungible tokens that can be easily traded on exchanges and used in applications across the web.

Form provides creators with an interface to distribute and share social tokens with their followers on other platforms and set up rewards for their followers to redeem social tokens for unique experiences across the web. 

Earn, redeem, send and trade social tokens across the internet. Web 2.0 or Web 3.0, itâ€™s easy with Form.
